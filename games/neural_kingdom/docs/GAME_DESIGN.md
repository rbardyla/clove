# Neural Kingdom - Game Design Document

## Vision Statement
A revolutionary action-RPG where every NPC has a fully-functioning neural brain with long-term memory, emotional states, and the ability to learn from player interactions. Built from scratch with ZERO external dependencies, proving that handmade development can exceed AAA quality.

## Core Innovation: Living World AI

### 1. **Neural NPCs with Persistent Memory**
- Every NPC uses our DNC (Differentiable Neural Computer) with EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation)
- NPCs remember EVERYTHING: past conversations, player actions, world events
- They form opinions, hold grudges, build friendships
- They learn combat patterns and adapt strategies

### 2. **Emergent Storytelling**
- No scripted quests - stories emerge from NPC interactions
- NPCs can become allies, enemies, or rivals based on YOUR actions
- The world evolves even when you're not there
- NPCs have their own goals and will pursue them

### 3. **Revolutionary Combat AI**
- Enemies learn your patterns in real-time
- They communicate and coordinate attacks
- They remember what worked and what didn't
- Boss fights that get harder as they learn YOU

## Technical Excellence Goals

### Performance Targets
- 144+ FPS on modest hardware
- < 100MB RAM for entire game
- Zero loading screens
- Instant hot-reload during development

### AI Specifications
- 100+ concurrent neural NPCs
- Each NPC: 256-neuron brain with 1MB persistent memory
- 60Hz AI update rate
- Real-time learning with no frame drops

## Development Methodology

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Basic player movement with perfect feel
2. Single room with collision
3. One neural NPC that can see and react
4. Debug visualization for everything

### Phase 2: Combat (Week 2)
1. Melee combat with perfect game feel
2. Enemy that learns your attack patterns
3. Visual feedback for AI decisions
4. Performance profiling

### Phase 3: Memory System (Week 3)
1. NPC long-term memory implementation
2. Conversation system with context
3. Reputation/relationship tracking
4. Memory visualization in editor

### Phase 4: Emergent Behavior (Week 4)
1. NPC goals and motivations
2. Dynamic quest generation
3. World simulation when off-screen
4. AI society interactions

## The Handmade Advantage

**Why we'll beat AAA engines:**
1. **Zero bloat** - Every byte has a purpose
2. **Perfect control** - We own every line
3. **Instant iteration** - Hot reload everything
4. **Predictable performance** - No black boxes
5. **Revolutionary AI** - Not possible in Unity/Unreal

## Success Metrics
- NPCs that players talk about like real people
- Combat that stays challenging after 100 hours
- Stories that emerge naturally from play
- Performance that embarrasses AAA games
- Code so clean it's beautiful
