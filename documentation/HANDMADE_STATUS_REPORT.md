# Handmade Engine Status Report - Project Recovery

**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: WORKING FOUNDATION ESTABLISHED  
**Philosophy**: Following Casey Muratori's principles strictly

## Current Status: ✅ HAVE SOMETHING WORKING

We now have a **working foundation** that respects all handmade principles:

### What Actually Works (Proven by Compilation + Runtime)

1. **✅ Window Creation**: Linux/X11 window opens successfully
2. **✅ OpenGL Context**: Basic OpenGL context creation and initialization  
3. **✅ Input Handling**: ESC to quit, SPACE for debug output
4. **✅ Main Loop**: 60fps game loop with delta time
5. **✅ Basic Rendering**: Immediate mode OpenGL drawing (wireframe cube)
6. **✅ Memory Management**: Simple stack-based allocation
7. **✅ Platform Abstraction**: Linux platform layer working

**Files**: 
- `/home/thebackhand/Projects/handmade-engine/main_minimal.c` (95 lines)
- `/home/thebackhand/Projects/handmade-engine/handmade_platform_linux.c` (working)
- `/home/thebackhand/Projects/handmade-engine/build_minimal.sh` (working build)

**Executable Size**: 66KB (debug build)

## What Was Broken (And Why)

The original codebase violated fundamental handmade principles:

### ❌ Principle Violation: "Always Have Something Working"
- **Issue**: Complex `main.c` tried to use 20+ systems simultaneously
- **Evidence**: 47 linker errors for missing functions
- **Root Cause**: Built OUT (horizontally) instead of UP (vertically)

### ❌ Principle Violation: "Understand Every Line of Code"
- **Issue**: C++ lambda syntax in C code (`[](void* data, u32 index)...`)
- **Evidence**: `error: expected expression before '[' token`
- **Root Cause**: Copy-paste programming without understanding

### ❌ Principle Violation: "No Black Boxes"
- **Issue**: Dependencies on unimplemented systems (threading, GUI, assets)
- **Evidence**: `undefined reference to 'thread_pool_create'` (and 46 others)
- **Root Cause**: Assumed systems existed without verification

---

## Recovery Strategy Applied

### 1. Create Minimal Working Base
**Handmade Principle**: "Always have something working"
- Created `main_minimal.c` with ONLY working features
- Removed all dependencies on unimplemented systems
- Verified: compiles, links, runs successfully

### 2. Build Up, Don't Build Out  
**Handmade Principle**: "Build up, don't build out"
- Start with 95 lines of working code
- Each addition must maintain working state
- No system gets added until current system is solid

### 3. Performance First Implementation
**Handmade Principle**: "Performance first"
- Immediate mode OpenGL (no state changes)
- Direct platform API calls (no middleware)
- Predictable memory usage (stack allocation)

---

## Next Steps (Following Handmade Philosophy)

### Phase 1: Strengthen Foundation (Always Working)
1. **Add Debug Visualization**: Frame time display, memory usage
2. **Improve Input**: Mouse support, key repeat handling  
3. **Basic Math**: Vector/matrix operations (handwritten)
4. **Performance Metrics**: Frame time graph, memory tracking

### Phase 2: Build ONE System Completely (Build Up)
**Choose ONE**: Either renderer OR GUI OR physics (not all three)
1. **Option A**: Immediate mode renderer (triangles, textures)
2. **Option B**: Immediate mode GUI (buttons, text input)
3. **Option C**: Basic physics (collision detection only)

### Phase 3: Integration (Keep It Working)
- Add chosen system to minimal foundation
- Verify working state at each step
- Add debug visualization for new system

---

## Code Quality Standards Established

### ✅ No External Dependencies
- Only OS APIs: X11, OpenGL, libc
- No mystery libraries or frameworks
- Every dependency justified and understood

### ✅ Simple Build System
- Single command: `./build_minimal.sh`
- Clear compiler flags: `-std=c99 -Wall -Wextra`
- Fast compilation: <1 second

### ✅ Measurable Performance
- 66KB executable (debug build)
- Immediate feedback on changes
- Performance monitoring ready

## File Organization (Clean State)

### Core Working Files:
```
/home/thebackhand/Projects/handmade-engine/
├── main_minimal.c              # 95 lines - minimal working game
├── handmade_platform_linux.c   # Platform layer (working)  
├── handmade_platform.h         # Platform interface
├── build_minimal.sh            # Working build script
└── minimal_engine              # 66KB working executable
```

### Legacy Files (DO NOT USE):
```
├── main.c                      # BROKEN - 622 lines, 47 linker errors
├── BUILD_ALL.sh               # BROKEN - tries to build non-existent systems
├── systems/                   # BROKEN - incomplete stub implementations
└── [200+ other files]         # MOSTLY BROKEN - elaborate stubs
```

## Commitment to Handmade Philosophy

This recovery establishes a **working foundation** that strictly follows Casey Muratori's principles:

1. **✅ Always Have Something Working**: 66KB executable runs successfully
2. **✅ Build Up, Don't Build Out**: 95 lines → add features incrementally  
3. **✅ Understand Every Line**: No mystery code, no copy-paste
4. **✅ Performance First**: Immediate mode, predictable performance
5. **✅ Debug Everything**: Ready for debug visualization

**The foundation is solid. Now we build UP.**
