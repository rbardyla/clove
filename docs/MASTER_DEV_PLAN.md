# MASTER DEVELOPMENT PLAN - Handmade Engine
## Following Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero Philosophy

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy
- **Build everything from scratch** - Understand every line
- **No hidden complexity** - No magic, no abstractions we don't control
- **Heavy validation** - Test and verify after EVERY implementation
- **Deterministic behavior** - Reproducible results always
- **Performance first** - Know where every cycle goes

## 🧪 VALIDATION PROTOCOL

### After EVERY Implementation:

#### 1. Unit Tests
```rust
#[test]
fn test_memory_arena() {
    let arena = MemoryArena::new(MEGABYTES(1));
    let ptr = arena.push_size(256);
    assert!(!ptr.is_null());
    assert_eq!(arena.used(), 256);
}
```

#### 2. Performance Benchmarks
```rust
#[bench]
fn bench_render_frame(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(|| {
        // Must maintain 60 FPS (16.67ms)
        render_frame(&mut game_state);
    });
}
```

#### 3. Memory Validation
- No heap allocations in hot path
- Verify arena usage stays within bounds
- Check for memory leaks with valgrind

#### 4. Integration Tests
- Full system test after each component
- Verify no regressions
- Test edge cases

#### 5. Visual Validation
- Render test patterns
- Compare against reference images
- Check for artifacts

let timer = Timer::start("render");
render_frame();
timer.end(); // Logs: "render: 2.3ms"

// Memory tracking
let before = arena.used();
do_work();
let allocated = arena.used() - before;
debug!("Allocated: {} bytes", allocated);
```

### External Tools
