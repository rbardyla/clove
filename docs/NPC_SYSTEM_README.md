# Complete NPC Brain System - Final Integration

This is the culmination of the handmade neural engine - a complete, intelligent NPC with persistent memory, emotional relationships, and real-time learning capabilities. Every component has been built from scratch in pure C with zero external dependencies.

## Architecture Overview

The NPC brain combines three key neural systems:

### 1. LSTM Controller (`lstm.h/.c`)
- **Purpose**: Sequential decision making and attention control
- **Architecture**: 512 inputs → 256 hidden units → 64 outputs
- **Performance**: < 0.4ms inference time
- **Features**: Forget/input/output gates, cell state management

### 2. DNC Memory System (`dnc.h/.c`) 
- **Purpose**: Persistent, associative long-term memory
- **Architecture**: 128 memory locations × 64 dimensions
- **Performance**: < 0.2ms read/write operations
- **Features**: Content-based addressing, temporal linkage, memory allocation

### 3. EWC Consolidation (`ewc.h/.c`)
- **Purpose**: Learning without catastrophic forgetting
- **Architecture**: Fisher Information Matrix for parameter importance
- **Performance**: < 0.1ms consolidation updates
- **Features**: Task-specific memory protection, adaptive learning rates

## NPC Capabilities

### Persistent Memory
- Remembers all past interactions across game sessions
- Associates experiences with emotional context
- Recalls specific events when contextually relevant
- Forms long-term relationship models

### Emotional Intelligence
- 32-dimensional emotional state space
- Personality archetypes (Warrior, Scholar, Merchant, Rogue, etc.)
- Emotional responses evolve based on interaction history
- Persistent trust, affection, and relationship bonds

### Skill Learning
- Learns combat preferences without forgetting social skills
- Acquires new abilities (trading) while retaining old ones (combat)
- Adapts behavior based on player interaction patterns
- Maintains consistent personality while growing

### Contextual Understanding
- 512-channel sensory processing (vision, audio, social context)
- Real-time attention mechanisms focus on relevant stimuli
- Environmental awareness (time, weather, social setting)
- Personality-based sensory filtering

## Performance Specifications
