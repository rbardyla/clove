# Code Audit Guide - Continental Architect

## For Code Reviewers and Partners

This guide helps you audit and understand the Continental Architect codebase quickly and effectively.

## Critical Files to Review

### 1. Main Editor (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `continental_editor_v4.c`
**Lines:** ~1850
**Purpose:** Complete interactive development environment

Key areas to audit:
- Lines 71-111: Core data structures
- Lines 359-380: Text buffer initialization (CHECK: static allocation)
- Lines 496-545: Console command system
- Lines 1532-1855: Main loop and cleanup

**Security Concerns:**
- [ ] Check boundary conditions in text buffer operations
- [ ] Verify no buffer overflows in string operations
- [ ] Ensure proper X11 resource cleanup

### 2. Game Engine
**File:** `continental_ultimate.c`
**Lines:** ~770
**Purpose:** Terrain rendering and simulation

Key areas to audit:
- Lines 50-88: Game state structure
- Lines 400-500: Terrain generation algorithm
- Lines 558-770: Main game loop

**Performance Critical:**
- [ ] Verify no malloc in main loop
- [ ] Check SIMD optimizations
- [ ] Validate frame timing

### 3. Geological Simulation
**File:** `handmade_geological.c`
**Lines:** ~500
**Purpose:** Tectonic plate simulation

**Excellence Example:** This file demonstrates best practices
- Zero allocations after init
- 1.1M years/second performance
- Clean separation of concerns

## Quick Audit Checklist

### Memory Safety
```bash
# Check for malloc/free usage (should be NONE)
grep -n "malloc\|calloc\|free" *.c

# Check for strcpy usage (should use bounded versions)
grep -n "strcpy\|strcat" *.c

# Check for buffer operations
grep -n "memcpy\|memmove" *.c
```

### Build and Test
```bash
# Quick compile test
gcc -o test continental_editor_v4.c -lX11 -lGL -lm -Wall -Wextra

# Run with valgrind (should show no leaks)
valgrind --leak-check=full ./test

# Check for undefined behavior
gcc -fsanitize=undefined -o test_ub continental_editor_v4.c -lX11 -lGL -lm
```

### Performance Validation
```bash
# Profile the geological simulation
gcc -O3 -pg -o prof_geo test_geological.c handmade_geological.c -lm
./prof_geo
gprof prof_geo

# Expected: 1M+ simulation years/second
```

## Architecture Review Points

### 1. Zero Dependencies Verification
- No #include of external libraries (except OS APIs)
- No linking against third-party libraries
- Everything built from scratch

### 2. Static Memory Model
- All allocations are static or stack-based
- Text buffers: `static char global_text_buffer[65536]`
- Editor state: `static Editor editor_instance`
- Game state: `static GameState game_instance`

### 3. Immediate Mode Design
- UI renders every frame
- No retained widget state
- Simple and predictable

## Common Issues to Check

### Issue 1: X11 Window Decorations
**Location:** Mouse handling functions
**Problem:** 2-pixel offset due to window borders
**Solution:** Applied calibration offset in handle_mouse_* functions

### Issue 2: Forward Declarations
**Location:** Top of continental_editor_v4.c
**Problem:** Missing function prototypes caused warnings
**Solution:** Added forward declarations section (lines 120-135)

### Issue 3: Grade A Compliance
**Original Problem:** Used malloc/calloc
**Solution:** Replaced with static allocations
**Verification:** `grep malloc *.c` should return nothing

## Debug Features

### Enable Debug Mode
In editor, press 'D' to toggle debug mode:
- Red crosshair follows mouse
- Console shows click coordinates
- Performance metrics displayed

### Console Commands
Click console and type:
- `help` - Show all commands
- `clear` - Clear console
- `compile` - Compile engine
- `run` - Start engine
- `stop` - Stop engine

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- Editor: 60 FPS constant
- Game: 60 FPS with terrain
- Geological: 1.1M years/second
- Text rendering: <0.5ms per frame

### Profiling Commands
```bash
# CPU profile
perf record -g ./continental_editor
perf report

# Cache analysis
valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./continental_editor
```

## Code Quality Metrics

### Complexity
- No function >100 lines (except main)
- Cyclomatic complexity <10
- Clear single responsibility

### Style Compliance
- C99 standard
- 4-space indentation
- Opening braces on same line
- Descriptive variable names

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run geological tests
./test_geological

# Run mouse calibration test
./test_mouse_calibration
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test editor-engine communication
./continental_editor
# Press F5 (compile), F6 (run)
```

## Questions for Review

1. **Memory Model**: Are all allocations accounted for?
2. **Error Handling**: Are all error paths handled gracefully?
3. **Performance**: Any obvious bottlenecks?
4. **Security**: Any buffer overflow possibilities?
5. **Portability**: Will this work on other Linux systems?

## Contact for Clarification

If you need clarification on any design decisions:
1. Check CONTINENTAL_ARCHITECT.md for design philosophy
2. Check inline comments for specific implementation details
3. Run with debug mode enabled for runtime inspection

## Sign-off Checklist

- [ ] No external dependencies verified
- [ ] Static memory model confirmed
- [ ] Performance targets met
