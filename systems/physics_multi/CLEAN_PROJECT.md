## What Was Cleaned

- ✅ 51 files → 15 organized items
- ✅ All test files moved to tests/
- ✅ All old versions archived
- ✅ Build scripts organized
- ✅ Only production code in core/
- ✅ Clean root directory

## For Your Partner

Start with `AUDIT_GUIDE.md` - it has everything needed for code review.

The entire production codebase is just 3 files in the `core/` directory.
