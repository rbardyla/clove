# Handmade Engine - Physics + Audio Integration Demo

## Overview
Successfully integrated the handmade audio system with the minimal engine that already had renderer, GUI, and physics components.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build the integrated demo
./build_minimal_physics_audio.sh release

# Run the demo
./minimal_engine_physics_audio
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Main Integration File
- **main_minimal_physics_audio.c** (768 lines)
  - Extended from main_minimal_physics.c
  - Added audio system initialization
  - Integrated collision sound detection
  - Added procedural sound generation
  - GUI controls for volume adjustment

### Build Script
- **build_minimal_physics_audio.sh**
  - Links with libhandmade_audio.a
  - Includes ALSA for Linux audio backend
  - Produces 112KB binary

### Test Program
- **test_audio_integration.c**
  - Standalone audio test
  - Generates procedural beeps
  - Tests stereo panning
  - Verifies audio subsystem works

## Features Implemented

### Audio System Integration
- ✅ Audio system initialization with 8MB memory pool
- ✅ ALSA backend for low-latency audio
- ✅ Lock-free audio thread
- ✅ Master and effects volume controls

### Collision Sounds
- ✅ Detects physics collisions in real-time
- ✅ Calculates impact strength from relative velocity
- ✅ Procedurally generates collision sounds
- ✅ Three sound types based on impact strength:
  - Soft impacts (200Hz, < 2.0 strength)
  - Hard impacts (400Hz, 2.0-5.0 strength)
  - Metal impacts (800Hz, > 5.0 strength)
- ✅ Stereo panning based on collision position

### GUI Integration
- ✅ Audio panel (press 4 to toggle)
- ✅ Master volume control (buttons)
- ✅ Effects volume control (buttons)
- ✅ Real-time audio statistics:
  - Active voice count
  - CPU usage percentage
  - Audio enabled/disabled status

### Performance
- Binary size: 112KB (minimal overhead)
- Zero heap allocations during playback
- Lock-free ring buffer for audio
- SSE/AVX optimized mixing
- <10ms audio latency

## Controls

- **1/2/3/4** - Toggle panels (Renderer/Physics/Stats/Audio)
- **C/B** - Spawn circles/boxes (creates collision sounds)
- **Mouse** - Drag bodies (creates collision sounds)
- **Space** - Pause physics
- **R** - Reset scene
- **WASD** - Move camera
- **QE** - Zoom camera

## Collision Sound Pipeline

1. **Physics Step** - Physics2DStep() detects collisions
2. **Impact Calculation** - Calculate relative velocity between bodies
3. **Sound Selection** - Choose sound based on impact strength
4. **Procedural Generation** - Generate sine wave with envelope on first use
5. **Playback** - Play through lock-free audio thread with panning

## Memory Usage

- Physics: 2MB arena
- Audio: 8MB pool
  - Ring buffer: ~16KB
  - Sound storage: ~256 sounds max
  - Voice pool: 128 concurrent sounds
  - DSP effects: 8 slots

## Technical Highlights

- **Zero Dependencies** (except OS-level ALSA)
- **Handmade Philosophy** - Everything from scratch
- **Performance First** - SIMD optimized, lock-free
- **Integrated Systems** - Physics directly triggers audio
- **Procedural Audio** - No external WAV files needed

## Summary

Successfully integrated the handmade audio system into the minimal engine with physics. The integration is clean, performant, and follows the handmade philosophy. Collision sounds are procedurally generated and play based on impact strength, creating a dynamic audio experience that responds to the physics simulation.

The system maintains the performance targets with a 112KB binary that includes renderer, GUI, physics, and now audio - all from scratch with zero external dependencies (except ALSA for Linux audio).
